# Simplified Chinese Subtitle Translation Project for Developing iOS 10 Apps with Swift

[中文版本](../README.md)

We have not yet finished translating. You may view our progress by

- [Watching the repository](https://github.com/ApolloZhu/Developing-iOS-10-Apps-with-Swift/subscription)
- [Viewing Kanban for project progress](https://github.com/ApolloZhu/Developing-iOS-10-Apps-with-Swift/projects/1)

If you are interested in joining us, and helping us translate, please read [Translation Instructions/Proofread Guidelines (Chinese)](../translation-instructions.md) carefully，and refer to [Must knows about collaboration (Chinese)](https://github.com/ApolloZhu/Developing-iOS-10-Apps-with-Swift/issues/2). We reserve rights to close any pull request that doesn't follow these regulations.

### Download Subtitiles

Please download the [Project Zip Archive](https://github.com/ApolloZhu/Developing-iOS-10-Apps-with-Swift/archive/master.zip). You can find original subtitles in folder `en/subtitles`, and translated subtitles in folder `subtitles`.

The subtitles are provided as `.srt` files, therefore, you need video players that will support loading external subtitle files, such as [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html). If you are unable to decode subtitle files correctly, please search for the solutions form, and/or report new issues to [Encoding Issues (Chinese)](https://github.com/x140yu/Developing_iOS_8_Apps_With_Swift/issues/131).
