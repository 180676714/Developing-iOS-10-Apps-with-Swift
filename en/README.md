### Download Subtitles

Please download the [Project Zip Archive](https://github.com/ApolloZhu/Developing-iOS-10-Apps-with-Swift/archive/master.zip). You can find original subtitles in folder `en/subtitles`, and translated subtitles in folder `subtitles`.

The subtitles are provided as `.srt` files, therefore, you need video players that will support loading external subtitle files, such as [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html). If you are unable to decode subtitle files correctly, please search for the solutions form, and/or report new issues to [Encoding Issues (Chinese)](https://github.com/x140yu/Developing_iOS_8_Apps_With_Swift/issues/131).
